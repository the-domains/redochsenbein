# About Red

My name is Red Ochsenbein and I am a composer, orchestrator and arranger living in Burgdorf, Switzerland.

My music is being used in games, commercials and for international promotion-campaigns for movies, TV-series and TV-shows. Additionally my music can be heard on MTV, ABC, NBC, Eurosport and other TV channels.

Currently I am working on game and movie projects, write music for trailers, production music libraries and commercials and produce demos for commercial soundsets and sample libraries.

I strongly believe music will play an important part in the future media world. I would love to help interesting projects to finally come alive and deliver the emotions to your audience.
